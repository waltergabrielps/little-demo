* When click on “Edit Tags“ option:
    * A dropdown should display containing an input field to add custom Tags alongside a “Save” and “Cancel’ buttons.
    * If the Artifact already has Tags associated, these should be already set on that input.
    * If the Artifact does not have any Tags associated, the input should be empty.
    * Once Tag(s) are added/edited and saved, these changes should be visible under the Artifact information (Search header) and also on the input.
